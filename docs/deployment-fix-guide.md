# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Guide

## Current Issue
The website is showing a 404 error on GitHub Pages. This is likely due to one of the following issues:

## Solutions

### 1. Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/tinninhi/solveme-protocol-website
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Make sure:
   - Source is set to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch is set to "main" (or "master")
   - Folder is set to "/ (root)"

### 2. Verify File Structure
Ensure all files are in the root directory of the repository, not in a subdirectory.

### 3. Check index.html
The main `index.html` file must be in the root directory and properly formatted.

### 4. Force Rebuild
1. Go to repository Settings > Pages
2. Click "Save" to trigger a rebuild
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

### 5. Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. Clone the repository
3. Add all files to the root directory
4. Commit and push changes

### 6. Check Repository Visibility
Since the repository is private, make sure:
- GitHub Pages is enabled for private repositories
- You have the necessary permissions

### 7. Manual File Upload
If the above doesn't work:
1. Go to repository on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Upload all HTML files to the root directory
4. Commit changes

## Quick Test
Create a simple test file to verify deployment:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Test Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>GitHub Pages Test</h1>
    <p>If you can see this, GitHub Pages is working!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Save this as `test.html` and upload it to verify the deployment is working.
